# Retail Sales Analysis

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- MySQL
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Excel

## Objective
This project is designed to demonstrate SQL and Python skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries and Excel. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL and Python.

## Project Structure
1. **Set up a Retail Sales Database**: Create a retail sales database with provided sales transactions and responses, inserting them into respective tables.
2. **Importing the Dataset**: Use the Pandas library to import sales data transactions and sales data responses, merge them into a single dataset, and understand the dataset for further analysis.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand and gain insights from the dataset.
